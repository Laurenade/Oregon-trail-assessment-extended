// The Traveler class (blueprint) should set the following
// properties for each instance:
//  ----- a name, which must be provided as a parameter to the constructor.
//  ----- an amount of food, with an initial value of 1.
//  ----- an isHealthy property, with an initial value of true, which
//      indicates whether a traveler is sick.
// The Traveler class should also have the following methods:
//      ----- hunt() - Increases the traveler's food by 2.
//      ----- eat() - Consumes 1 unit of the traveler's food. If the
//          traveler doesn't have any food left to eat, the traveler
//          is no longer healthy (set isHealthy to false).

//Extend :
// The Doctor class will extend the Traveler class and have one additional method:
//      - heal(traveler) - set the traveler's isHealthy property to true.
// The Hunter class will extend the Traveler class, but it will start with 2 food
// instead of 1. The Hunter class should also have the following methods:
//      - hunt() - Increase the hunter's food by 5. (A normal traveler gains only 2.)
//      - eat() - Consumes 2 units of food. If the hunter doesn't have 2 food when
//          they are instructed to eat, they eat as much as they can (0 or 1 unit),
//          but the hunter is no longer healthy.
//      - giveFood(traveler, numOfFoodUnits) - Transfers numOfFoodUnits from the
//          hunter to the traveler. If the hunter doesn't have enough food, then
//          no food should be transferred.

// this.food>=numofFoodUnits
